            <p>Ok so listing out hobbies feels a bit off. So heres little details. <br> I love reading books. I especially read novels and I've read many of them. <br>
                I favourite genre is gothic. I also love fantasy fiction. The lord of the rings has to be one of my favorite series.<br>
            About f1, I've been following it for 5 years now and it is very exciting!<br>
            It is a very intense sport even if it dosent really appear that way. AND I love MAX VERSTAPPEN!!
